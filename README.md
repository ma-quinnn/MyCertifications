ðŸŽ¯ My Certification Roadmap


I believe in building real skills before collecting certifications.
Right now, I'm actively exploring and learning through hands-on practice, platforms like TryHackMe, and building real-world projects.

ðŸ§­ Once I have a clear understanding of:

âœ… My strongest technical skills

âœ… The career path I want to focus on (e.g., Blue Team, AI Security, Web Security)

âœ… The areas I still need to study

â€¦then Iâ€™ll pursue industry-recognized certifications like CompTIA Security+, SAL1, or Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1).

ðŸ“Œ Certifications will come â€” but only after the skills are earned and the direction is clear.
This journey is about mastery, not rushing. ðŸ’ª
