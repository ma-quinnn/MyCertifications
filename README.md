🎯 My Certification Roadmap


I believe in building real skills before collecting certifications.
Right now, I'm actively exploring and learning through hands-on practice, platforms like TryHackMe, and building real-world projects.

🧭 Once I have a clear understanding of:

✅ My strongest technical skills

✅ The career path I want to focus on (e.g., Blue Team, AI Security, Web Security)

✅ The areas I still need to study

…then I’ll pursue industry-recognized certifications like CompTIA Security+, SAL1, or Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1).

📌 Certifications will come — but only after the skills are earned and the direction is clear.
This journey is about mastery, not rushing. 💪
